## Exploratory Data Analysis with R-base plots
This repository provides some basic exploratory analysis on household electric power consumption. This dataset measured the electric power consumption with a one-minute sampling for about 4 years. The data that were covered in this project is the electric consumption from February 1 to 2 of 2007. This filtered data is in this repository named `housepower.txt`, while the full dataset is found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip).

This repository contains four R scripts that creates the corresponding plots below. 

**Plot 1: Global Active Power Histogram**
